# CUBESAT_IITISOC-project

As part of an academic and practical exploration into space systems, I designed and analyzed a CubeSat structure with the following key highlights:

🛠️ 3D Design & Integration: Created a detailed fusion model of the CubeSat frame using Fusion 360, including accurate placement of key internal components like sensors, batteries, and other electronics.

🔬 Structural Analysis: Performed modal, thermal, and static structural analysis using ANSYS to ensure mechanical stability, durability, and performance under space-like conditions (launch and orbit scenarios).

🧪 Simulation-Driven Development: Verified that the design can withstand vibration frequencies during launch and remain thermally stable in low Earth orbit.

This project helped me develop a deep understanding of satellite design principles, multiphysics simulations, and integration of mechanical and electronic subsystems.
